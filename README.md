## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- When it comes to deciding whether to use flesbox or grid for the layouts I find it best to use whatever the situation calls for. I decided to use flex for the top portion of the main container because of the uneven columns.

- I was reminded that flex-basis is an important flex property when defining a major row. CSS grid makes this a little easier to do especially if the columns are the same width.

### Continued development

- Getting faster in conceptualizing/deploying layouts.
